## How to Run

### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Input data file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the program.

### Steps to Compile and Execute
1. **Compile the Program**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:  
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o program -lm
   This will generate an executable file named program.

2. **Prepare the Input File**:
   Create an input.txt file in the following format:
   - The first line contains the column headers for the Var2 values.
   - The second line contains the numerical values of Var2.
   - The subsequent lines contain Var1 values followed by their corresponding measurements.
     
Example:

Var1/Var2   1.0   2.0   3.0
1.0         2.1   2.3   2.5
2.0         3.2   3.4   3.6

3. **Run the Program**:
Execute the compiled program.

4. **Provide Inputs**:
The program will ask for:

- Number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Coefficients for the user-defined equation.
- Tolerance values for mean and standard deviation.

5. **Output**:

- Results will be displayed on the terminal.
- A detailed report will be written to result.txt.
